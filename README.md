This is an Editor project built for a JetBrains internship application.

### Features

Editor pane highlights hard keywords always and soft keywords where appropriate.
New highlights are easily added by overriding appropriate methods inside the 
[Annotator](composeApp/src/jvmMain/kotlin/com/zeks/jetbrains/task/editor/Annotator.kt).

Console features color coding for standard and error output and user input. Error messages that include
paths of the currently opened file are clickable and will focus the editor pane on the corresponding line.

When a process is finished or forcefully stopped, the console will show the exit code of the process.
